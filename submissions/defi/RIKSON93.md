## Developer
- **Name**: RIKSON93
- **GitHub**: @RIKSON93
- **Discord**: rikson93
- **Experience**: Experienced in running Web3 testnet nodes (Cosmos, Monad, Nexus, Pipe Network, etc.), Solidity smart contracts, and building dApps with React and TypeScript. Participated in several hackathons and contributed to testnet infrastructure projects.

## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Defi Swap
- **Category**: defi

### Description
DeFi Swap is a decentralized swapping platform that allows users to exchange tokens seamlessly with low fees and high scalability.
The problem it solves: most existing swap platforms have high transaction fees and limited scalability.
Our solution: a lightweight, secure swap dApp built on top of the Soundness Layer to ensure proof-based authentication, transparent settlement, and smooth user experience.

### SL Integration  
- **Authentication**: Users authenticate with Soundness Layer credentials before initiating swaps.
- **Transaction Proofs**: Each swap is validated using SL proofs, ensuring transparency and preventing malicious activity.
- **Auditing & Analytics**: Swap events are logged through SL for future monitoring, analytics, and compliance.

## Technical

### Architecture
DeFi Swap consists of a frontend dApp that interacts with smart contracts deployed on the Soundness testnet.
Users authenticate via the Soundness Layer (SL), submit swap transactions, and receive SL-verified proofs of execution.
Contracts handle swap logic, liquidity pools, and fee collection. An optional backend provides analytics and monitoring.

### Stack
- **Frontend**: React + TypeScript + Web3.js/Ethers.js
- **Backend**: Node.js (optional for analytics dashboard)
- **Blockchain**: Soundness Layer (SL) + Solidity smart contracts
- **Storage**: On-chain event logs + optional IPFS for analytics/archival

### Features
1. Token-to-token decentralized swaps with SL verification
2. SL-based authentication for secure access control
3. Transparent transaction logs and proof-based auditing

## Timeline

### PoC (2-4 weeks)
- [ ] Week 1: Implement basic swap contract on SL testnet
- [ ] Week 2: Integrate SL authentication + transaction proofs
- [ ] Week 3: Build minimal frontend UI for swaps
- [ ] Week 4: End-to-end testing + deploy PoC demo

### MVP (4-8 weeks)  
- [ ] Week 1: Expand swap contract to support multiple token pairs
- [ ] Week 2: Implement liquidity pool management (add/remove liquidity)
- [ ] Week 3: Build improved frontend with transaction history
- [ ] Week 4: Add SL-based proof explorer for swaps
- [ ] Week 5–6: Optimize smart contracts and fees
- [ ] Week 7: Security audit + bug fixes
- [ ] Week 8: Public test release and feedback collection

## Innovation
Unlike standard DEXs, this DeFi Swap integrates **Soundness Layer proofs** for every transaction.
This ensures verifiable execution, transparent audits, and trustless settlement.
Users will prefer it because it combines **low-cost swaps + verifiable security** using SL.
